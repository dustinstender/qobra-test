## Data
Each user has a name, an objective and an id (which will be used to reference the user in a deal).
Each deal has an amount and a user who closed the deal.

## Goal

We're trying to calculate the compensations of 2 users, knowing what deals they sold during the month.

## Commissioning

Your objective is to calculate the compensation of each user, knowing that they are commissioned as such:
- 10% of what they sell if they sold 1 or 2 deals during the month
- 20% of what they sold if they sold 3 deals or more
- 500 euros bonus if they sold more than 2000 euros in the month
